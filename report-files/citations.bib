abstract="We present a CBR approach to musical playlist recommendation. A good playlist is not merely a bunch of songs, but a selected collection of songs, arranged in a meaningful sequence, e.g. a good DJ creates good playlists. Our CBR approach focuses on recommending new and meaningful playlists, i.e. selecting a collection of songs that are arranged in a meaningful sequence. In the proposed approach, the Case Base is formed by a large collection of playlists, previously compiled by human listeners. The CBR system first retrieves from the Case Base the most relevant playlists, then combines them to generate a new playlist, both relevant to the input song and meaningfully ordered. Some experiments with different trade-offs between the diversity and the popularity of songs in playlists are analysed and discussed.",

abstract="Constructive adaptation is a search-based technique for generative reuse in CBR systems for configuration tasks. We discuss the relation of constructive adaptation (CA) with other reuse approaches and we define CA as a search process in the space of solutions where cases are used in two main phases: hypotheses generation and hypotheses ordering. Later, three different CBR systems using CA for reuse are analyzed: configuring gas treatment plants, generating expressive musical phrases, and configuring component-based software applications. After the three analyses, constructive adaptation is discussed in detail and some conclusions are drawn to close the paper.",
